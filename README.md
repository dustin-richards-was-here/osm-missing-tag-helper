# osm-missing-tag-helper

Adjust the bbox variable to match your desired search area, and run the script to locate amenity=restaurants, =cafes, and =fast_foods that are missing an opening_hours=* tag. Links that you can easily right click and open (at least in `bash`) will be spit out to the terminal, along with a notice if any found elements are missing `name=*`.
